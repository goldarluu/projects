<h1>Blockchain ( Tutorial by Dave Nash) </h1>

I coded this blockchain by following Dave Nash's tutorial, however I changed a few things on how the classes were done. I implemented it to return private variables, instead of being a public variable. 
I learned that this allows for information to be secure and safe, by learning hash maps and tables, I would like to give it a go for my own hash function rather than just relying on sha256 abeit it is incredible powerful.
