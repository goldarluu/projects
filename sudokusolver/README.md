My first and most favorite C++ program, this program, given any sudoku board will be able to check if there exist a solution or not. If there does exist a solution, then the program will return the solution is a 9 x 9 table with the answers filled in. (Truly just wrote this for my grandma because she loves Sudoku, but can't solve it for some reason.)
