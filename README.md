These are all my projects that I have done in the past semester that I have started learning programming. They demonstrate my understanding of data structures, file management, and simple algorithms. I hope to improve my skillset, so feel free to comment on any issues with my code! Thank you for viewing my GitHub profile.  

In here will also include my most recent or current project, which as of 7/22/2021 will be my COVID Vaccination Rate versus Socioeconomic Levels In California (Measured by Median Household Income of Counties).
