Cookie Recipe Program: 
This is my first project that I had collaborated with a peer from my C++ 2 Programming course. 

Within this program, I demonstrate proficiency in linked list, multi-file C++ program, and data structures. 

The program itself allows you to check recipes of the cookies listed, each cookies's calories, ingredients in each cookie, and also to calculate the amount of the cookies you are able to eat given a certain caloric limit.
