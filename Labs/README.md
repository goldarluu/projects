These are all the labs I have done in my C++ 2 Programming course. 

Lab 2 - > Singly Linked List simple algorithms to traverse through it. 
Lab 3 - > Simple insertInOrder function for Doubly Linked Lists
Lab 5 - > Eve and her Suitors : Simple vector based traversal to find a certain index 
Lab 9 - > Iterative, binary, and recursive binary search on arrays
